BE - Simulation d'un écosystème

This project is a simulation of an ecosystem of creatures in an aquarium, aiming to explore and demonstrate how different creatures 

interact when equipped with sensors, accessories, and various behaviors. The system simulates diverse behaviors of the creatures: gregarious, fearful, kamikaze, 
cautious, and with multiple personalities, while taking into account different sensors (such as eyes and ears) and accessories (such as fins, shells, and camouflage).
